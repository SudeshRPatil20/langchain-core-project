Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot project on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned. Indira Gandh i National Open \\nUniversity has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis  Ababa and \\nHarmaya Universities.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.
